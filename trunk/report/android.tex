\chapter{Android app} % application?

	% Brief description and scope for this chapter
	
	\paragraph{}
	One fairly important stage of this project was the development of an application
	based on the mobile operating system Android. This application acts as the receiver
	part of the whole product, which depends on the emitter module in order to work
	properly.
	
	\paragraph{}
	Features and requirements will be dealt in deep detail later on, but it would be
	relevant to cite the main guidelines for this application's development.\\
	The chosen device belongs to the portable multi-touch category, products commonly referred as
	``tablets''.\\
	The application should be able to communicate and receive ecg data from Bluetooth
	or ZigBee emitter devices, deal and show this data to the user as well as
	save it for potential future revisions.
	This kind of devices are usually equipped with Bluetooth radio modules, but the same
	cannot be said about ZigBee ones. So as to make the device compatible with this
	technology the application should be made so that it could incorporate and use
	extra components ---this task was carried out through the USB interface---.
